# GlitchArt
A collection of my Glitch Artwork for Creative Coding


For this project I decided to select various stock images of meetings. I decided to choose this group of photos for the abundance of faces (which look cool while glitching) and the humorous concept of glitched chaos in sterile office environments. This came across well in my opinion, especially in the gifs as after a few moments it gets very hard to tell what's going on. I chose a combination of hex edited, pixel sorted, and datamoshed images, while the gifs were all datamoshed using the Tomato.py library. I had a lot of fun working with this project and tweaking the settings as I found methods that gave me the most satisfying glitches. Throughout the media and the internet I had always seen images using these techniques and am glad I understand how they work now.
